At DesignHub, I led the UX team in revamping the companyâ€™s flagship product, resulting in a 30% increase in user engagement. My role involved conducting user research, creating personas, and collaborating closely with cross-functional teams to implement design solutions that balanced user needs with technical feasibility.

Previously, I worked at Innovate Studios, where I contributed to a variety of projects ranging from mobile applications to enterprise software. One notable project was designing an e-commerce platform that streamlined the shopping experience, which led to a 20% boost in conversion rates. This experience honed my ability to adapt to different industries and understand unique user requirements.
