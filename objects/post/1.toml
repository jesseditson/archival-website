There's something liberating about beginning again. Not as a failure or a retreat, but as a conscious choice to shed what no longer serves and embrace what might be.

I've been thinking about this a lot lately—how we carry forward patterns and assumptions without questioning them. This space is an experiment in letting go of that weight.

No grand plans. No elaborate structures. Just thoughts, images, and moments worth preserving.

## Why Start Over?

Every creative person faces this question eventually. When do you iterate, and when do you burn it all down? I used to think starting over was admitting defeat. Now I see it differently.

The best work often comes from the clarity of a fresh start. You bring forward only what matters—the hard-won lessons, the core truths—and leave behind the cruft. All those decisions that made sense at the time but now just create friction.

## The Weight of Legacy Code

In software, we call it technical debt. In life, it's just... baggage. The difference is that in code, you can run tests to see what breaks. In life, you just have to trust your instincts.

I've carried forward so many patterns simply because they were there. Default settings I never questioned. Structures that served a purpose once but now just take up space.

## This Space

So here we are. A new experiment. A place for fragments and observations. No pressure to be comprehensive or authoritative. Just honest.

Some posts will be long like this one. Others will be a single image or a passing thought. The only rule is: does it feel true?

Let's see where this goes.
