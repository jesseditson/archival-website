This post demonstrates every markdown element supported by the blog, showcasing the clean, minimal design system that makes content readable and beautiful.

## Typography

Good typography is the foundation of readable content. This blog uses a carefully selected type scale that adapts across devices.

### Headings Hierarchy

Headers create structure and visual rhythm. We support three levels for optimal organization.

#### Subheadings

Even smaller headings maintain the typographic hierarchy while providing flexibility in content structure.

## Text Formatting

Emphasis and importance can be conveyed through **bold text** and *italic text*. You can even combine them for ***bold italic text*** when you really need to make a point.

Sometimes you want to highlight `inline code` within a paragraph, which uses our monospace font family for technical clarity.

## Lists

### Unordered Lists

Simple bullet points for non-sequential information:

- First item in the list
- Second item with more detail
- Third item to demonstrate spacing
- Fourth item showing consistency
- Final item with a longer description to demonstrate how text wraps within list items

### Nested Lists

Lists can be nested for hierarchical information:

- Top level item
  - Nested item one
  - Nested item two
    - Deeply nested item
  - Back to second level
- Another top level item
  - With nested content

### Ordered Lists

When sequence matters, use numbered lists:

1. First step in the process
2. Second step follows naturally
3. Third step builds on previous
4. Fourth step continues the flow
5. Final step completes the sequence

### Mixed Lists

You can combine ordered and unordered:

1. Main topic
   - Supporting point
   - Another detail
2. Second topic
   - Related information
   - Additional context

## Blockquotes

Quotes deserve special visual treatment to stand out from regular text:

> The details are not the details. They make the design.

> Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.
>
> Multi-paragraph quotes maintain their visual cohesion while providing clear separation between thoughts.

### Nested Blockquotes

> Sometimes you need to quote within a quote.
>
> > This nested quote demonstrates how depth can be visualized.
>
> Back to the main quote level.

## Code Blocks

Code deserves special formatting with syntax awareness:

```javascript
function renderMarkdown(markdown) {
    if (!markdown) return '';

    const lines = markdown.split('\\n');
    let html = '';

    return html;
}
```

Multi-line code blocks preserve formatting:

```javascript
const config = {
    theme: 'minimal',
    colors: {
        primary: '#3b82f6',
        background: '#0a0a0a'
    }
};
```

Here's some CSS:

```css
.viewer-post-content {
    font-size: 1.1rem;
    line-height: 1.8;
    color: var(--text-secondary);
}
```

And some HTML:

```html
<div class="container">
    <h1>Hello World</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
</div>
```

## Links

Links are styled to be obvious but not obtrusive. Here's a [link to example.com](https://example.com) that demonstrates the hover effect.

You can also create [reference-style links][ref] that keep the text clean.

[ref]: https://example.com

## Horizontal Rules

Section breaks create visual breathing room:

---

Content above the rule.

---

Content below the rule.

## Images

Images should integrate seamlessly with text:

Images with captions tell richer stories.

## Tables

Structured data needs clear presentation:

| Feature | Status | Priority |
|---------|--------|----------|
| Headers | ✓ Done | High |
| Lists | ✓ Done | High |
| Tables | ✓ Done | Medium |
| Code | ✓ Done | Medium |

### Aligned Tables

| Left Aligned | Center Aligned | Right Aligned |
|:------------|:--------------:|--------------:|
| Text | Text | Text |
| More | More | More |

## Task Lists

Track progress with checkboxes:

- [x] Completed task
- [x] Another finished item
- [ ] Work in progress
- [ ] Future task

## Footnotes

Text with footnotes[^1] provides additional context without disrupting flow[^2].

[^1]: This is the first footnote with detailed information.
[^2]: Footnotes can contain **formatting** and [links](https://example.com).

## Definitions

CSS
: Cascading Style Sheets - the language for styling web pages

Markdown
: A lightweight markup language for formatting text

## Abbreviations

The HTML specification is maintained by the W3C.

*[HTML]: Hyper Text Markup Language
*[W3C]: World Wide Web Consortium

## Strikethrough

Sometimes you need to show ~~mistakes~~ corrections in your text.

## Subscript and Superscript

Chemical formulas like H~2~O and mathematical expressions like x^2^ need special formatting.

## Highlighted Text

You can ==highlight important text== to draw attention.

## Emojis

Native emoji support makes content more expressive! 🎨 ✨ 🚀

## Special Characters

Smart quotes "like this" and apostrophes don't create issues. Em dashes—like this one—separate thoughts. Ellipses... create suspense.

## Escape Characters

Sometimes you need to show \\*actual asterisks\\* without formatting.

## Combination Examples

### Rich Content Block

Here's a complex example combining multiple elements:

**Project Status Update**

Our Q4 roadmap includes:

1. **Design System** - *In Progress*
   - Color palette ✓
   - Typography ✓
   - Components 🚧
2. **Documentation** - *Planned*
   - API reference
   - Component guides
3. **Testing** - *Not Started*

> The attention to detail makes the difference between good and great.
