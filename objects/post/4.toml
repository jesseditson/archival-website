The internet loves before-and-afters. The struggle, then the triumph. What gets lost is everything in between.

I want to share more of the messy middle—the false starts, the pivots, the moments of doubt. Not for sympathy, but because that's where the actual work happens.

This blog is part of that practice. Small updates, unpolished thoughts, works in progress. Building in public, one small piece at a time.
