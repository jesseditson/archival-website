I've been experimenting with attention as a design constraint. Not time management or productivity—attention.

What deserves mine? What quietly steals it? The answers reveal what I actually value versus what I claim to value.

Uncomfortable but clarifying.

## The Attention Economy

Everyone talks about the attention economy like it's something happening to us. Apps designed to be addictive. Notifications engineered to hijack our focus. Algorithms optimized for engagement.

All true. But also: we have more agency than we admit.

## What You Pay Attention To Grows

This isn't mystical thinking. It's simple cause and effect. Whatever you focus on, you notice more of. You develop sensitivity to it. You start seeing patterns. You get better at it.

Pay attention to design, you start noticing good design everywhere. Pay attention to writing, you become a better writer. Pay attention to drama, and suddenly your life is full of it.

Your attention is literally constructing your reality.

## The Practice

For the past month I've been tracking my attention. Not in a productivity-optimization way. Just... observing. Where does it naturally go? What pulls it? What holds it?

The results surprised me:
- I check email reflexively, not because I expect something important
- I read Twitter when I'm avoiding something difficult
- I'm most focused in the early morning, completely scattered after 3pm
- I can sustain deep work for about 90 minutes, then I need a real break

None of this is revolutionary. But there's a difference between knowing something abstractly and confronting the actual data of your behavior.

## Designing for Attention

Once you see the patterns, you can design around them. I don't check email until 11am now. Twitter is blocked during work hours. I do creative work in the morning, meetings and admin in the afternoon.

Simple changes. Massive impact.

The real shift though? I stopped trying to "be productive" and started asking: what deserves my attention right now? Sometimes that's work. Sometimes it's rest. Sometimes it's just sitting and thinking.

Trust the attention. Follow what's alive.
