One of my most rewarding projects was developing a mobile app for mental health awareness called MindfulSpace. I was responsible for the end-to-end design process, including user interviews, journey mapping, and interactive prototyping. The app received acclaim for its user-centric design and has helped thousands of users manage stress and anxiety.

Another project I’m proud of is EcoTrack, a web platform that encourages sustainable living by tracking personal environmental impact. By incorporating gamification elements and a clean, intuitive interface, we engaged users to make eco-friendly choices. The platform was recognized in the “Best for the World” list by a leading environmental organization.
